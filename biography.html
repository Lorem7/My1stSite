                        When he was yet five years of age his mother noticed that her son showed abilities for drawing, and it was at that time that Oleg stated that he would be an artist.
                        At the age of ten he enrolled in a local art school for kids, where his natural talent blossomed under the guidance of the skilled artist Galina Stepanovna Tsapko.

                <div class="block2">
                    <p>At the age of 14 he entered an Art Collage, painting and art teachers department in Vladivostok where he
                        received professional skills and a degree.
                        The artist was especially impressed by the love for landscape and still life paintings.
                        Trying to utilize any spare moment with his easel he would leave the city to go to the countryside art retreats to do nature study drawings.

                        urban exhibitions in different cities of Russia – Moscow, Vladivostok, Sochi, and Krasnodar.
                        His friends and colleagues notes that Oleg's art is filled with a poetry of sunshine and warmth that gives a
                        spectator high positive emotions and joy. The artist works exclusively in a classical style of realism in which details are portrayed very delicately
                        and where the atmosphere and entirety of vision creates an impression of unified environment.
